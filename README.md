## NavLink Component
NavLink is just like Link, with one additional feature: 

- If at page that link would go to, the <a> gets a CSS class of active

- This lets you stylize links to “page you are already at” using the activeStyle (in-line) or activeClassName props

You should include an exact prop here as well

Very helpful for navigation menus
